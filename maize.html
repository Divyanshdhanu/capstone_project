          <h3 class="mt-3">About Maize</h3>
        <p class="para">
                Maize (Zea mays L) is one of the most versatile emerging crops having wider adaptability
                under varied agro-climatic conditions. Globally, maize is known as queen of cereals
                because it has the highest genetic yield potential among the cereals. It is cultivated
                on nearly 150 m ha in about 160 countries having wider diversity of soil, climate,
                biodiversity and management practices that contributes 36 % (782 m t) in the global
                grain production. The United States of America (USA) is the largest producer of
                maize contributes nearly 35 % of the total production in the world and maize is
                the driver of the US economy. The USA has the highest productivity (> 9.6 t ha-1
                ) which is double than the global average (4.92 t ha-1). Whereas, the average productivity
                in India is 2.43 t ha-1</p>
            <p class="para">
                In India, maize is the third most important food crops after rice and wheat. According
                to advance estimate its production is likely to be 22.23 M Tonnes (2012-13) mainly
                during Kharif season which covers 80% area. Maize in India, contributes nearly 9
                % in the national food basket. In addition to staple food for human being and quality
                feed for animals, maize serves as a basic raw material as an ingredient to thousands
                of industrial products that includes starch, oil, protein, alcoholic beverages,
                food sweeteners, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, film, textile, gum, package and paper
                industries etc.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                The maize is cultivated throughout the year in all states of the country for various
                purposes including grain, fodder, green cobs, sweet corn, baby corn, pop corn in
                peri-urban areas. The predominant maize growing states that contributes more than
                80 % of the total maize production are Andhra Pradesh (20.9 %), Karnataka (16.5
                %), Rajasthan (9.9 %), Maharashtra (9.1 %), Bihar (8.9 %), Uttar Pradesh (6.1 %),
                Madhya Pradesh (5.7 %), Himachal Pradesh (4.4 %). Apart from these states maize
                is also grown in Jammu and Kashmir and North-Eastern states. Hence, the maize has
                emerged as important crop in the non-traditional regions i.e. peninsular India as
                the state like Andhra Pradesh which ranks 5th in area (0.79 m ha) has recorded the
                highest production (4.14 m t) and productivity (5.26 t ha-1 ) in the country although
                the productivity in some of the districts of Andhra Pradesh is more or equal to
                the USA.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                Maize can be grown successfully in variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay
                loam. However, soils with good organic matter content having high water holding
                capacity with neutral pH are considered good for higher productivity. Being a sensitive
                crop to moisture stress particularly excess soil moisture and salinity stresses;
                it is desirable to avoid low lying fields having poor drainage and also the field
                having higher salinity. Therefore, the fields having provision of proper drainage
                should be selected for cultivation of maize.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on maize was launched in 1957 with
                the objective to develop and disseminate genetically superior cultivars and production/protection
                technologies. AICRP organizes interdisciplinary, interinstitutional, co-operative
                and systematic testing of newly developed cultivars of both public and private sectors
                for different agro-climatic zones of the country. The project resulted in refining
                efforts in varietal improvement. Since 1961, a total number of 187 cultivars including
                single cross hybrids, composites and multiple parent crosses have been released
                nationwide. In India, maize is traditionally grown in monsoon (Kharif) season, which
                is accompanied by high temperature (&lt;35&deg; C) and rainfall. However, with the
                development of new cultivars and appropriate production technology, winter cultivation
                of maize has emerged as a viable alternative.
